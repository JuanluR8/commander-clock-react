# Commander Clock

Motivated by my Magic the Gathering (MtG) games in store with friends, 
sometimes we used to play timed tournaments when it's important to track each player time.

So this app only purpose is to make it easy, for a 4 players Commander game to track each player game time
as a countdown timer.

> ğŸ’¡ Original idea from TheCommandZone Commander Clock app.

# Setup ğŸš€

```shell
# Install dependencies
pnpm install

# Run project
pnpm run dev
```

# How to use ğŸ¦®

The app consists in 4 panes, one for each player, where it's displayed the remaining game time for that player.

In the app center, there is a buttons menu where you can increase/decrease initial time limit for each player, 
same as a button to restart the game and reset each player clock.

To start/pause a clock just click on the pane with the clock, or another player clock to move turn.
